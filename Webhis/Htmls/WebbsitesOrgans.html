              <p class="Normaltext">Behind every website there is long textfiles containing the commands needed to make the website look like it does. Different elements and functions create animations and styles.</p>
              <p class="Specialtext">The base code for every website is HTML (HyperText Markup Language) which is basically just a long textfile. CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) is what gives the websites the color and the ability of customization. JS (Javascript) is used for scrips on websites and can also be used with animations and buttons.</p>

          <h5>HTML</h5>
          <h3>HyperText Markup Language</h3>
          <p> HTML stands for hypertext markup language and is the code that is the base of every single website in the world. Without HTML a website would not exist. Although by only using HTML and no CSS or JS then the website would look very boring. Click <a href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html">here</a>&nbsp;to see an example. </p>
          <h3>What's the use for it?</h3>
          <p> HTML is used for the writing, links, pictures, sound, and video on the webpage and tells the web browser what the website should look like. It also contains the metadata information which is for example character encoding, content, author, and keywords. </p>
          <h3>HTML 5</h3>
          <p> HTML was made by&nbsp; <a href="/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium" title="World Wide Web Consortium"> World Wide Web Consortium</a> (W3C). The current version of the language is HTML 5 (2022). It works by using elements to create the websites. An example of very simple HTML code can be seen in the picture. </p>

            <h5 style="color: #ffffff;">Cascading Style Sheet</h5>
            <h3>CSS</h3>
            <p> CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) was created by Håkon Wium Lie on 10 October 1994 and is the language used by websites to give their distinct and well-made design. Without CSS, websites look like plain text files and are very boring. CSS can be used to change Fonts, Colors, Layouts, and Shapes. Therefore, This allows for the separation of content and presentation and can make the experience on a website much more enjoyable. </p>
            <p> Furthermore, it allows for an adaptable presentation of the website so it works on all sorts of devices either it being large or small screens. Another way the language is adaptable is by it being able to be used with any XML-based markup language such as SVG, MathML or XHTML. </p>
            <h3>Perks</h3>
            <p> With CSS, the amount of code in the document itself is significantly reduced, and makes the pages load faster in the browser by creating CSS stylesheet files. CSS can either be prioritized differently depending on if something is said in the CSS file or if it's said in the HTML file. </p>
            <h3>CSS 1, 2, 3</h3>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 40px;"> CSS 1 contains information about relatively simple formatting such as background colors, background images, fonts, and text alignment. CSS 2 goes a step further and provides the opportunity to design entire documents with positioned rectangular areas (DIVs, boxes) that were previously only possible with tables. CSS 3 includes several effects that today are not fully supported in all browsers but can still be used. </p>

          <h5>Javascript</h5>
          <h3>JS</h3>
          <p> Javascript is a language that is commonly used on websites when producing dynamic effects on the website. JS can be used for animations, video playback, interactive menus, and much more. You can also change different elements on the website by for example changing the background color when you click a picture. </p>
          <h3>Brendan Eich</h3>
          <p> Javascript was created by Brendan Eich who was an American developer. He wanted to create a language that would be used as a "glue language" for informal programmers and designers. Javascript allowed programmers to use JS to put together components and automate interactions. </p>
