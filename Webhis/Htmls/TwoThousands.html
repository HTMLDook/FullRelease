            <h5>The Internet We Know</h5>
            <h2>2000s Development</h2>
            <p class="Normaltext">At the start of the 2000s, people started to hang out in communities on different platforms and consuming and sharing large amounts of content.</p>
            <p class="Specialtext">There were also memes, blogs, news, movies and music all making their way into the evolving age of the internet. Although some of the movies and music may have not been obtained legally.</p>

        <h5>Pirated Music</h5>
        <h3>Kazaa and Napster</h3>
        <p> Kazza and Napster was a file-sharing program that scared the music industry because anyone in the whole world could share files. During this time, artists who put their music on the internet used mp3 files which you had to pay for and so if someone bought it and shared it on Napster, anyone could download it and use it. </p>
        <p> It was created by <a href=" https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/Niklas_Zennstr%C3%B6m2.jpg " target="_blank">Niklas Zennström</a> and also <a href=" https://res.cloudinary.com/crunchbase-production/image/upload/c_thumb,h_256,w_256,f_auto,g_faces,z_0.7,q_auto:eco,dpr_1/v1397180275/5891f445bbacbd86e987e87b1be243f7.png" target="_blank">Janus Friis</a>. It quickly became the world's most downloaded program with over a billion downloads by 2003. Although in the year 2006, Kazaa received a fine of 100 million dollars because of its illegal file-sharing service. This created a very bad reaction but ever since Napster and Kazaa, new services have been provided like Spotify and Itunes. </p>
        <h3>ADSL</h3>
        <p> With Napster and Kazaa came a much faster internet in the 2000s which was 10x faster than before. ADSL (Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line) was a technology that could offer faster internet than the traditional internet could. The traditional way was by using called-up telephone lines. ADSL is known as a known technology that is driving many internet connections over the whole world. </p>

          <h5 style="color:#ffffff">Open Forums <br>And Free Information</h5>
          <h3>Flashback</h3>
          <p> One of the upcoming communities on the internet was Flashback which is an internet forum that took shape in the 2000s. It's Sweden's oldest forum and still exists to this day. </p>
          <p> Everything was being discussed, such as pets, family life, science, weapons, and politics and it gave the people a real feeling of almost total freedom of speech. Of course, the website was moderated to stop cyberbullying or harassment. </p>
          <h3>Swedens First Meme</h3>
          <p> In 2001 came Sweden's first viral success "Ansiktsburk" which spread like wildfire throughout the Swedish internet users and also made its way onto Flashback. It's considered Sweden's first meme. </p>
          <p> It was originally a song in Arabic made by Patric Nyberg and the person who made the meme was Daniel Blå. He thought that the song text sounded almost like Swedish words and so he put it in the video and gave it the title "Ansiktsburk". It can be seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=an_8U-GDgwc" target="_blank" style="color:#f9f9f9 ">here.</a>
          </p>
          <h3>Wikipedia</h3>
          <p> In 2001 another type of informational forum came around called Wikipedia. Today it's one of the world's biggest pools of information where you can find almost anything. It renews the encyclopedias and was free for anyone to use and edit. Although Wikipedia is thoroughly moderated so one can't just go in and write false information. </p>

        <h5>Communication</h5>
        <h3>Dark Net</h3>
        <p> Although parts of the world don't want everyone to have access to certain information. In 2002 the TOR (The Onion Router) was created by the American military to keep the internet a bit more secretive. </p>
        <p> It was called the dark net and was an encrypted network with multiple layers of encryption which is a reference to the Onion in the browser's name. With this, you could now surf the web without leaving a trace. Many drug cartels, pedophiles, terrorists, and murderers use this network to communicate with a much lower risk of getting caught. </p>
        <h3>Skype</h3>
        <p> Another form of communication for more normal people was Skype. It was started by the sweed <a href=" https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/Niklas_Zennstr%C3%B6m2.jpg " target="_blank">Niklas Zennström</a> in 2003 and he managed to make phone calls free. Skype was a service that let you call people over the internet through normal phones and computers. </p>
        <p> It was quickly picked up and used by companies as well for a cleaner and better way of communicating. Although in 2005, Skype was bought by eBay for 19 billion Swedish crowns which made Zennström one of Sweden's richest people. Then Skype was sold to Microsoft for 50 billion Swedish crowns and has been downloaded 160 million times. </p>

        <h3>Facebook</h3>
        <p> It was now that the community started connecting. With new forms of communicating and a growing interest in the internet and its power, new websites and programs came here and there. In 2004 Mark Zuckerberg and a couple of other students at Harvard university founded Facebook. It was a community for Harvard students to chat, and find friends. Within a month, more than half of the university's students had become members. Then students from Stanford, Yale, and Columbia are also registered. </p>
        <p> In 2005, Facebook opens to everyone and anyone over the age of 13 could register for an account. For the first time, a community breaks through where users use their real names, which means that you mainly communicate with your regular friends. Words like "like" and "status update" are catching on on a broad front. </p>
        <h3>Blogs</h3>
        <p> And with Facebook also came the blogging age. When Swedes started blogging for real and it quickly became of the most popular hobbies. The first ever blogger in Sweden was Nanok Bie who created the blog between 1995 and 1996. He founded the website Reload.org where many of Sweden's early bloggers started their journey. In 2005, Isabella Löwengrip became Sweden's biggest blogger. She was 14 years old at the time and had read an article and a newsletter about how you make a blog. She went by the name Blondinbella. </p>
        <p> It was quickly picked up and used by companies as well for a cleaner and better way of communicating. Although in 2005, Skype was bought by eBay for 19 billion Swedish crowns which made Zennström one of Sweden's richest people. Then Skype was sold to Microsoft for 50 billion Swedish crowns and has been downloaded 160 million times. </p>

        <h5>Worlds Most Known Website</h5>
        <h3>Youtube</h3>
        <p> Another huge step in the development of the internet was when in February of 2005, a website was created where anyone could upload a video clip. This website would soon become the world's most-known website and its called Youtube. Youtube's founders are Chad Hurley, Jawed Karim, and Steve Chen and they wanted to create a service where it was easy to share video clips with friends and the world. The first ever youtube clip can be seen bellow. </p>

        <h5>The Expansion Of The Internet</h5>
        <h3>PirateParty</h3>
        <p> In 2006, a political party by the name of "piratpartiet" was founded and managed to reach the EU-Parlament withing three years.

The party leader, Rickard Falkvinge means that the copyright to movies, music, files, and documentns should be free for anyone to access for free. With this, they mean that you would no longer have to pay to see movies or download music. </p>
        <h3>Spotify</h3>
        <p> A service that could provide free music without you having to pay anything was Spotify. A Swedish invention made by Daniel Ek and Martin Lorentzon. Spotify quickly became the largest streaming service for music and when you get the app you can either get the free version which had advertisements or a paid version without advertisements. It could be used on mobile devices, tablets, and computers either in a browser or a downloadable program. </p>
        <h3>Twitter</h3>
        <p> Another form of sharing also came out in 2006 when the Americans Jack Dorsey, Evan Williams, Biz Stone, and Noah Glass founded a new service that allows for quick and easy status updates.

          <h5>Ios vs Android</h5>
          <h3>Android & IOS</h3>
          <p> In 2008 two different types of operating systems came out for the smartphones we have today. IOS and Andriod, the feud between the two would gradually grow as to who can dominate the smartphone market. In 2008 came the first iPhone and the first android HTC Dream. </p>
          <p> IT entrepreneur Andy Rubin had a vision of an open-source mobile operating system. In 2003, he starts Android (which at first will only work on cameras), and two years later he booked a meeting with Google to investigate interest. Soon Google bought the operating system for 50 million dollars. </p>
          <p> Google own andriod and wanted to create an operating system that could dominate the market and win over Apple's IOS. Android is both free and freely customizable for mobile manufacturers because it's open source so anyone can use and customize the code in whichever way they want. In the first quarter of 2015, Android had 78 percent of the smartphone market in the world </p>

        <p> in 2009 the world's first digital currency came called Bitcoin. A cryptocurrency that allowed direct transfers between users without the use of any bank or middle hand that would have to process the transfer. Although this currency cant is used anywhere. For example, you can't go to the supermarket and buy groceries with it. Although there are websites where you can sell your bitcoin and get real money for it. It was created by Satoshi Nakamoto As bitcoin became more popular the value of the coin went up and down. In 2010 a user was able to purchase two pizzas for 10000 bitcoin which is equivalent to (1.7 billion Swedish crowns 2022-11-23). </p>
        <h3>Ipred Law</h3>
        <p> Another importance of 2009 was the creation of “Ipred-lagen” where Ipred stands for Intellectual Property Rights Enforcement Directive. The law was supposed to make it easier to find and prosecute illegal file sharers. This means, among other things, that the person who has the copyright to a work has the right to demand information from internet providers about their users via court, if they suspect rights infringement, for example, that someone illegally downloads or uploads a film or a song. The law is met with a lot of criticism because of personal integrity. </p>

        <h3>Bank ID & Swish</h3>
        <p> Mobile bank ID and Swish managed to sweep the runway with a new found way to make money transfers much safer and easier. Mobile Bank ID was launched in 2011 and Swish was launched the following year. This made it possible for the person sending money to be able to accept the transfer with a Mobile Bank ID. To send money through swish you only need a QR code or a number, nothing else. It suddenly becomes easy to split the bill for a restaurant visit or to buy an old vase at the flea market without having to handle cash. The use of both Mobile Bank ID and Swish increases greatly throughout the 2010s. </p>

        <p> In 2013 a whistleblower by the name of Edward Snowden reveal something terrible. The mass surveillance program was launched by the US Authorities who had complete control over everyone's online communication. The newspapers The Guardian and the Washington Post reveal that the British and American intelligence services have been conducting extensive surveillance of internet traffic for many years. </p>
        <p> It concerns everything from emails to personal photos and phone calls, to chats in computer games. Everything can be tracked in real-time. Swedish users who use foreign services are also included in the results. In 2014 Edward Snowden is awarded "the alternative Nobel prize" and The Right Livelihood Award. His whistle-blowing is an important milestone in the debate about privacy online, and he is praised by many but also criticized by American politicians and government officials who believe that he betrayed his country. </p>

        <h3>Amazon Echo</h3>
        <p> In 2014 came the Amazon Echo. A digital assistant that could be placed anywhere at home so that you can ask about the weather, times, and sports results at any time. It becomes a reality when the Amazon Echo is presented. But it soon turns out that even AI needs a human ear sometimes. Voice recognition is of course nothing new. </p>
        <p> Already in the 1960s, IBM presents a machine that can identify 16 spoken words and numbers and convert them into text. But it is with the Amazon Echo that the voice takes physical form. The smart speaker is born, and it should be placed centrally in the home and, through the assistant Alexa, is always ready to respond to the owner's commands. Concern exists early on about placing a powered microphone in one's residence, but it seems to soon pass. The product is a success. </p>
        <h3>Internet Museum</h3>
        <p> Something else that also came in 2014 was Swedens largest internetmuseum. Internetmuseum.se timeline streches from the 60s till the present. It covers questions like: Who were the pioneers? What have we loved, hated and laughed at? And how did Sweden become one of the world's most digitally developed countries? </p>

          <h5>Soon To Be Most Popular Social Media</h5>
          <h3>Musical.ly</h3>
          <p> Musical.ly was a Chinese video app that quickly spread around the world from 2014 to 2017. The app allowed the creation of videos that could be seen on a flow page in the app so you could scroll and see videos from anybody. You could also send messages and have live videos where you can talk to your fans. </p>
          <p> The users could create 15-second clips of different speeds and choose any soundtrack for it and even create their own. In 20016 the app had over 90 million registered users which created approximately 12 million new videos per day. One of the trends that blew up on Musical.ly was the Ice Bucket Challange which can be seen bellow. </p>

          <h3>Tiktok</h3>
          <p> Musical.ly was bought by Bytedance in 2017 and merged with TikTok in 2018. Tiktok is the most downloaded app in the world (2022). So what is it that made the app so incredibly popular? One explanation is the ability to post whatever you want and with the help of TikTok's algorithm, it's possible to get a lot of views and reach out even if you don't have a huge number of followers. </p>
          <p> This is also different from its predecessor musical.ly which was more focused on showcasing clips from big accounts. On Tiktok, more people get the opportunity to be seen. Each account has its feed that serves clips upon clips selected by Tiktok's algorithms. The recommendations are not based on how many followers someone has but on more different things like trends, places, popular jokes, and more. </p>

        <h5>Other Important Happenings</h5>
        <h3>Net neutrality</h3>
        <p> Net neutrality is introduced in Sweden and now it's the same for everyone. In 2016, an EU regulation was introduced in Sweden that prohibits operators from lifting forward certain internet traffic at the expense of someone else. This is to make it fair for everyone using the internet so the poor won't has to suffer because of the rich getting their traffic lifted forward. Net neutrality thus becomes law. </p>
        <h3>Pokemon Go</h3>
        <p> Pokemon Go fever worldwide in 2016 and suddenly everyone is out hunting for Pokemon. It first came out in Australia, New Zealand, and the United States. But was then released in the rest of the world and quickly became the most downloaded game in world history, and in just five weeks the manufacturer gets over a billion kroner in revenue. </p>

        <h5>Privacy On The Internet</h5>
        <h3>GDPR</h3>
        <p> GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) gives the private person greater power over their data. Europe is at the forefront of online privacy issues. GDPR secures rights for citizens and at the same time becomes something of a world standard. It starts with Nazi Germany. Surveillance has long been the status quo for many Germans, from the Gestapo to the Stasi. </p>
        <p> Meanwhile in West Germany, data storage laws were already introduced in 1970 which are about letting the private individual have the right to their data and curbing abuse. Personal privacy had truly became a burning issue In the unified Germany, all citizens now have the right to access data collected about them. </p>
        <p> Here the foundation is laid for why it is the EU that is the world leader in matters of personal integrity. In 1995, a data storage law was introduced about what you may and may not collect about different people. </p>
        <h3>#MeToo</h3>
        <p> #MeToo makes history, a worldwide movement that starts with a hashtag. The hashtag #metoo draws attention to sexual harassment against women and goes global. Already in 2006, the American Tarana Burke created the hashtag to draw attention to the situation of black young women in vulnerable areas. But it only became widespread when the actress Alyssa Milano asked women who had been sexually harassed to respond to her tweet with the exact words "me too". </p>
